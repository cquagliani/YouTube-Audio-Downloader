# YouTube-Audio-Downloader
This program is designed to extract the audio from each video within a specified YouTube playlist. The audio files are then downloaded to appropriate subfolders on the local hard drive, organized by genre.

During my years of intense studying at UC Berkeley, I developed a habit of listening to instrumental lofi music to focus for long periods of time. Through my experience, I have discovered that the best lofi music is found on YouTube.

Without YouTube Premium, a typical user is required to keep the app open while listening. This major inconvenience led to the need for this program. I now create playlists with my favorite focus music and download them to my computer for easier access.
