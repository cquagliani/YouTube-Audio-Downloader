# YouTube-Audio-Downloader
<p>During my years as an undergraduate student at UC Berkeley, I developed a habit of listening to instrumental lofi music to focus for long periods of time. Through my experience, I have discovered that the best copyright-free lofi music is found on YouTube, but I sometimes found the video itself distracting, so I created this program.</p>

<p>This Python program provides a command-line interface for extracting audio from each video within a specified YouTube playlist and saving them as mp4 files on your local computer. It utilizes the YouTube API to access the video and audio streams.</p>
